        In the world of professional snooker — a game similar to pool, played
        throughout the U.K. — there is confusion about the word tactic. Loosely
        put, there are two kinds of shots in snooker. There are attempts to
        pocket balls and score points, and there are safety shots where the goal
        is to make things more difficult for your opponent. A frame of snooker
        can descend into a protracted exchange of safety play — not particularly
        compelling to the casual observer — with neither player attempting to
        pocket balls. Such frames are described as “tactical.” This is wrong.
        The proper word would be “strategic.”
